## The Challenge

Create an iOS application that pulls in top content from the iTunes Store and presents the data to the user of the app. You are encouraged to be creative and explore areas that interest you.  

## The Rules

1. Spend at least 4 hours, but ***no more than 8 hours*** on this challenge.  
2. Do not use storyboards and shy away from XIBs unless you are running out of time.  Instead, build interface elements programmatically whenever possible.
3. You may not use any third-party SDKs.
4. The spirit of the challenge is such that your work herein should be net-new code.  You are permitted to use a _very limited amount_ of existing code you've written, for expediency. Just be sure that any of your pre-existing code is clearly marked as such.
